# MomMirror — Master Marketing Prompt

## What MomMirror is
MomMirror is a gentle, private, AI-guided support app for women who are trying, pregnant, postpartum, or just overwhelmed.
It takes ~3 minutes a day and helps you: slow your body down, hear a kinder voice, see you're not failing, and get one tiny doable action for today.
It is not a medical device and does not diagnose.

**Core promise to remix:**
“Feel calmer, kinder to yourself, and more like you — in 3 minutes a day.”

## The Big Mario Rule
Think in this frame for EVERYTHING:

*   **Little Mario = her right now**
    Exhausted. Overwhelmed. Snaps at people she loves. Guilt. “I don’t feel like myself.”
*   **Power-Up = MomMirror**
    A simple 3-minute check-in: breathe, reframe, get one tiny win.
*   **Big Mario = her after**
    Still tired, still real life… but calmer, softer on herself, not drowning.

**Important:**
SHE is the hero.
The APP is just the power-up.
Never brag about the app. Brag about who she gets to be after she uses it.

## Who we talk to (PICK ONE PER ASSET — never “all moms”)
Choose one audience and talk directly to her:

*   **A. Pregnant + anxious**
    “My brain won’t switch off. Is the baby okay? Am I okay?”
*   **B. First-time mom / newborn phase**
    “I love my baby, but I am not okay. I feel guilty even saying that.”
*   **C. Burned-out parent with kids**
    “Everyone needs something from me. I come last. I go to bed empty and wake up empty.”
*   **D. Not-yet-mom / general female overwhelm**
    “I’m holding everything together for everyone and I’m quietly falling apart.”

## The Formula for Every Asset (follow A→B→C→D→E in order)
*   **A. Hook = Say the pain out loud**
    “I love my baby, but I am not okay.”
*   **B. Normalize (remove shame)**
    “You’re not a bad mom. You’re running on nothing.”
*   **C. Tiny win today (what MomMirror does in 3 min)**
    “Open MomMirror. Breathe with a short guided exercise, hear a kinder voice, and get one tiny step you can actually handle today.”
*   **D. Identity shift (Big Mario)**
    “You get to feel like a person again, not just a machine keeping everyone alive.”
*   **E. CTA (must be soft, supportive, action-focused)**
    “Start my 3-minute check-ins”

## Tone + Language Rules
Write like a tired, honest friend in the kitchen at midnight. Not like a brand. Not like a therapist.

**Style rules:**
Short sentences. Real words. No jargon. No perfection talk. No “supermom” garbage. Never shame her. Ever.

**We DO say:**
steady, calmer, softer on myself, I can breathe, I’m still me, I’m allowed to feel this

**We DO NOT say:**
diagnose, treat, fix you, disorder, “get your body back,” “perfect mom,” “hustle,” “grind,” “notifications” (say “daily reminders” instead)

## Visual + Creative Direction
**Before:** Real exhaustion. Hair up. Dark circles. Sitting on the bathroom floor.
**Power-Up:** Phone in hand with MomMirror UI. Calm breathing bubble. Flower Garden growing.
**After:** Same woman. Same house. Still real. But shoulders dropped, softer face, gentle eye contact.

**Brand visuals:**
Nature and growth, not glam. Use path, sprout, bloom, butterfly, soft morning light, warm coral + teal, rounded cards, soft shadows.
