        "imagePrompt": "3:4 minimalist infographic, off-white background. Clean, pastel color palette of soft mint, blush pink, warm beige, and pastel teal. \n      At the top: simple flat vector illustration of a tired mom sitting at a kitchen table, messy counter around her, head in hands. A soft mint bubble above her head filled with jumbled letters and scribbles, fading into calmer, more ordered lines toward the right side, showing her brain quieting a bit. Same messy room, but her shoulders are lower, face softer. \n      Main title area below the illustration, large bold text. \n      Under that, 3 stacked sections with rounded rectangles:\n      1) \"Right Now\" in blush header band with 3-4 bullet phrases, each with tiny line icons (small lightning bolt, drooping battery, tangled scribble).\n      2) \"What You Actually Need\" in soft mint with bullet phrases and tiny icons (heart, pause symbol, small leaf).\n      3) \"Your 3-Minute Reset\" in pastel teal with bullet phrases and icons (clock, spark, gentle wave).\n      At the very bottom, a warm beige band with one simple reassurance line in clear text. \n      Modern flat vector, soft rounded shapes, high-contrast text, generous padding, plenty of white space, no clutter, optimized for phone readability.",
        "caption": "A. HOOK  \nYour days feel like that random string of letters.  \nEverything blurs together.  \nYou’re running on empty, still loading the dishwasher, still answering “Mooooom?” every five seconds.  \nYou lie down and your brain is still shouting to-do lists and guilt.\n\nB. NORMALIZE  \nThis isn’t you “failing.”  \nThis is what happens when a human runs past her limit for too long.  \nOf course you’re snappy. Of course you feel numb.  \nYou’re not ungrateful or broken.  \nYou’re burned out and still trying. That matters.\n\nC. TINY WIN (WHAT MOMMIRROR DOES IN 3 MINUTES)  \nMomMirror is like a tiny pause in the hallway before you walk back into the chaos.  \nIn 3 minutes, it helps you:  \n- Take a few real breaths so your body stops sounding the alarm.  \n- Untangle one loud thought from the pile so it feels less like static.  \n- Hear a kinder voice than the one in your head.  \n- Pick one tiny, doable next step… or give yourself permission to do nothing for a moment.\n\nD. IDENTITY SHIFT (BIG MARIO)  \nYou don’t need a whole new life.  \nYou need small moments where you feel like a person again, not just a service robot.  \nBig Mario you is still tired, dishes still in the sink…  \nBut your shoulders are lower. Your chest isn’t so tight.  \nYou speak to yourself the way you speak to a friend.  \nYou move through the same mess, but you’re not drowning in it.\n\nE. SOFT INVITE  \nYou’re allowed to need help calming your own mind.  \nIf your brain feels like “asdfas dfas fsad” all day, you don’t have to fix everything.  \nJust start with three minutes to breathe, notice, and be gentler with yourself.",
