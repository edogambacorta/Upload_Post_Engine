    "caption": "You are not the only mom lying awake, scrolling, googling, replaying the day and waiting for something to go wrong.\n\nThat knot in your chest. The tight jaw. The \"I should be sleeping but I cannot\" spiral.\nThat is anxiety, not failure.\n\nYou are not a bad mom.\nYou are a brand-new human caring for a brand-new human.\nYour nervous system is just on maximum alert.\n\nHere are 6 tiny tips for mom anxiety at night:\n1. The \"one square breath\": Inhale for 4, hold 4, exhale 4, hold 4. Do this just 3 times. Not perfect. Just try.\n2. Say one sentence out loud: \"Right now, in this moment, my baby is safe enough and I am safe enough.\"\n3. Put your phone on the other side of the room for 10 minutes. If you still want it after, you can get up and grab it.\n4. Keep a \"worry pad\" by the bed. When a thought loops, write one messy line, close the notebook. You are allowed to leave it there.\n5. Relax just your tongue and shoulders. Notice what drops when you do. Let your jaw feel heavy.\n6. Choose one tiny anchor: a warm sip of water, a soft blanket, a hand on your heart. Tell your body, \"We stand down now.\"\n\nYou do not have to fix all your anxiety tonight.\nEven one small thing is enough.\n\nInside MomMirror, your 3-minute check-in gently walks you through:\n- A deep grounding breath\n- Naming the fear without judging it\n- Choosing ONE tiny action, like a sentence to tell yourself or a place to relax your body\n\nNo lectures. No pressure. Just a softer voice than the one in your head.\n\nYou still have the same baby. The same night feeds. The same laundry pile.\nBut you?\nYou get to feel a little less on fire.\nA little more like a person who happens to be a mom, not a robot who never gets to rest.\n\nIf tonight feels heavy, you do not have to power through it alone.",

You are exhausted and scared.\n\nHere are 6 tiny tips for \"Is my baby okay?\" anxiety:\n1. The 3-breath check: Look, listen, lightly touch. Take 3 slow breaths while you do it. Then step back. The check is complete.\n2. Set a \"reassurance rule\": \"I will check once, not three times, before I sit down again.\" Be kind with it. It is a goal, not a test.\n3. Create a short safety sentence: \"Babies are noisy sleepers. Noise does not mean danger.\" Repeat it as often as you need.\n4. Use a simple timer: When you put your baby down, set a 5–10 minute timer before the next check. Let the timer hold the worry for you.\n5. Limit late-night Dr. Google. Choose 1 trusted source you check during the DAY, not at 2 a.m.\n6. Put one hand on your heart and one hand on the crib/bassinet and say, \"I am doing enough. I am allowed to blink.\"\n\nYour baby does not need a perfect, always-alert robot.\nThey need a human.\nAnd humans need breaks.\n\nInside MomMirror, your 3-minute check-in helps you:\n- Catch the scary \"what if\" sentences\n- Swap them for one kinder, truer sentence\n- Choose one boundary with checking that still feels safe\n\nIt will not erase every fear.\nBut it will turn the volume down enough that you can sit, breathe, maybe even finish your tea while it is still warm.\n\nYou get to feel like a mom who cares deeply and also gets to rest her eyes.\nYou get to be present with your baby without your heart racing all day.",

Then I will pick something and try it for 24 hours.\"\n4. Talk to yourself like a friend: What would you say to another new mom doing exactly what you are doing right now? Say that to yourself out loud.\n5. Keep a \"tiny wins\" note on your phone: \"Changed 6 diapers.\" \"Fed baby even though I was tired.\" \"Asked for help once.\" Read it when guilt gets loud.\n6.

Bright, white light can trick your brain into full alert.\n5. Micro-movement: roll your shoulders, stretch your neck, wiggle your toes. Tell your body, \"We are safe enough.
