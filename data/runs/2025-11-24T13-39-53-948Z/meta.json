        "caption": "That racing mind while your baby sleeps isn't your fault. Your body is in survival mode, and those midnight anxiety spirals are so normal they should be in parenting books. Instead of fighting your alertness, try this: Give yourself permission for a 3-minute \"sleep reset.\" Wrap yourself in something cozy, put one hand on your heart, and just breathe. No pressure to sleep. Just rest. Your body remembers how - it's just forgotten temporarily. You don't need to become a perfect sleeper. You just need these tiny moments of peace to remind your nervous system that it's safe to rest.",

But here's what helped other moms: Instead of forcing a schedule, try tracking your baby's natural patterns for just 3 minutes each morning. Notice when they're naturally sleepier. Work with their rhythm, not against it. Your instincts are better than any sleep training book. This phase will pass, and you're doing so much better than you think.",
