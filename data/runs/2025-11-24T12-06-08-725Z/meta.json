It's not just you. Your 3am worries don't make you a bad mom - they make you a mom who cares deeply. That racing mind is carrying so much love and responsibility.\n\nTake a slow breath with me. Just one. Your baby is sleeping. You're doing better than you think. 💜",

But these spinning thoughts? They're part of learning to be a mom, not signs you're failing at it.\n\nInstead of fighting the night spiral, let's breathe together. Your baby is safe. Tomorrow is a new day. And you're exactly the mom your little one needs. ✨",
